# dsa-with-c

A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in **C** as part of my learning journey.  
This repository serves as a personal reference and practice space for understanding core concepts of **DSA** and improving my **C programming** skills.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-with-c.git
    cd dsa-with-c
    ```
2. Compile any file using gcc (or your preferred compiler):
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ./output
    ```
3. Alternatively, use CMAKE (install cmake first):
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./my_program
    ```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., gcc, clang, or MSVC)

- Basic understanding of how to run C programs in your environment

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is not meant to be a production library but rather:

- A learning log as I practice DSA in C

- A place to revisit and review implementations

- A resource for anyone starting out with C and DSA

## 🤝 Contributing

Since this is primarily for my own learning, contributions might not be merged directly. However, feel free to open an issue or share suggestions if you spot errors or improvements.
